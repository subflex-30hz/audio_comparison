Hi there, here's a short description of what I want to achieve:

GOAL

An easy and user oriented way to A/B compare audio files by listening to them without any bias.

HOW is it working:

You're able to upload (RAM) up to 8 files in your browser.
  File size limited to 400MB to secure flawless working even with a 8GB RAM system
If you hit "START", the files will be randomized in order and displayed with their waveforms.
You can jump around and listen by using the arrow keys. Start/Stop with spacebar.
Vote your files with 5 stars at the right.
If you hit "reveal result", you will see the filenames and their respective voting.

Disclaimer:
Iâ€™m not a software developer, just an audio enthusiast trying to make life a little easier. If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out!
